# MDD participants compared to healthy age- and gender-matched controls

INQUISIT:
Inquisit software was used to run the experiment. 
Tasks were presented in the following order:
  2-back task practice;
  Eyes-closed resting state;
  IAPS;
  Eyes-open resting state;
  0-, 1-, and 2-back tasks;
 
The IAPS was delivered using three parallel lists with equivalent valence and arousal ratings (IAPS_A.iqx, IAPS_B.iqx, and IAPS_C.iqx). 


EEG PROCESSING:
Scripts can be run using MATLAB. 
Although not tested, open-source sofware Octave may also be able to run the scripts.
The MDDvsCTRL_pipeline calls all other scripts and coordinates processing steps. 


SPSS STATISTICAL ANALYSES:
Mixed-effects repeated measures model and regression analyses were performed using data in a longform data format. 
Fisher's Exact Test and Paired t-tests were performed using a wideform data format.
